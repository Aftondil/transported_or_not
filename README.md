Kaggle Challenge: Spaceship Titanic
Overview
This repository hosts the solution to a Kaggle challenge aimed at predicting whether individuals will be relocated to another planet based on a provided dataset. The challenge involves analyzing various factors to determine the likelihood of individuals being selected for relocation.

Dataset
The dataset is available in the data directory and contains the following file:

train.csv - This file includes the training data with features related to individuals' profiles and their relocation status.
Jupyter Notebook
The analysis and predictive modeling are performed in the Jupyter Notebook:

main.ipynb - Contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction. This notebook is designed to walk you through the entire process step-by-step.
Objective
The primary objective of this challenge is to use the provided data to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether people will be shipped to another planet. This involves understanding the data, cleaning it, engineering relevant features, and applying machine learning algorithms to make predictions.
